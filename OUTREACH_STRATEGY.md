# Korean Founder Outreach Strategy

## Research Findings

Based on extensive research, Korean indie makers and bootstrapped founders exist but aren't highly visible on international platforms like IndieHackers. The Korean startup ecosystem is growing rapidly with $8.95B in VC investments in 2024 and strong government support.

## **Phase 1: Direct Outreach (Week 1-2)**

### Target Platforms & Communities

3. **University Networks**
   - KAIST startup incubators
   - Seoul National University entrepreneurship programs

### Initial Target List (10 Founders)

- Solo developers with products generating $500-5000 MRR
- Side project builders with paying customers
- Recently graduated developers with MVPs
- Non-VC funded Korean startups with traction
